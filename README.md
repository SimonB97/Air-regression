# Air Regression

The goal of the project is to go through the [CRISP-DM cycle](https://www.atr-software.de/leistungen/ki/) of a Machine Learning Project.
For this project in particular, that means:
- Analyse the dataset 
- Discover and present patterns that you find
- Train a regressor on humidity and minimize the mean squared error
- Use XAI tools to explain your classifier to stakeholders and debug it

## The datasets
The dataset is public from the [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality).
